Spread the word to all parents who want their 3-year-olds in a part-time preschool where they will explore the world, build, paint, create and imagine! Instead of sitting at a desk, filling out worksheets.

Send us the children who will gasp and say, "Look at this ant!" Because our teacher will stop and truly LOOK at it with them.

Our school teaches children - not short adults. Our school teaches them how to communicate, manage disagreements, wait, share, and delay gratification - the skills you really need for kindergarten.

And also all those little things like learning how to write - with paint brushes, magnet pens and shaving cream.

Let's hear it for learning through play!

(Potty training not required.)
