Is play-based preschool right for your 3-year-old? We're holding a tour on Friday at 3:30 p.m. Bring your child, meet the teacher, and see what play-based school is all about! Potty-training is NOT required.

Friday doesn't work for you? Call us at (518) 370-5705 to schedule a tour!

The co-op rents space at 852 Ashmore Ave., Niskayuna.

For 3-year-olds, preschool is on Tuesdays and Thursdays, September to June, from 9 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. Parents are welcome in the classroom and take part in their child's first school experience, getting to see them grow and develop.

We are in an allergy-aware building, and we have experience with life-threatening allergies.

The co-op also runs a class for 4- and 5-year-olds. It runs Monday, Wednesday and Friday, September to June.
