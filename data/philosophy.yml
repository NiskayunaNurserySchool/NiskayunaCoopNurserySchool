title : Our Educational Philosophy
description : Children are encouraged to be independent and self-motivated by learning through self-directed play and guided group activities. They are allowed to grow at their own pace while learning social, emotional, and intellectual skills.
description2 : A cooperative nursery school is a school in which parents have the unique opportunity to participate in their child’s first experience with school. Through their involvement in the classroom, parents ease the children’s transition from home to a classroom environment while seeing for themselves how their children learn and grow and interact with others.
description3 : Self Esteem and independence are so important in a child’s development. Niskayuna Co-operative Nursery School works with you and your child to develop these skills for the coming years. Your child will get the confidence they need to take the next step to Kindergarten and the Elementary School years ahead.
