    content : The summer playdates were a great way to meet the families before the school year started.  I also appreciated the home visit before the start of school from our teacher Ms. Ober.  Her visit got my daughter so excited for her first day.

    content : Our new teacher, Ms. Pam Ober, has been a model of patience, kindness, and enthusiasm for our children.  Fall has been so much fun in Mrs. Ober's class.  We went  apple picking, tasted the apples for snack, then the children made a felt board model of the different types of apples.  We had a frighteningly cute Halloween parade and Party where the kids, parents, and Ms. Ober got in the spirit.  Most recently, we made a Sharing Soup that each child brought in an ingredient.  What a great hands-on way to taste the benefit of sharing!  We are looking forward to a terrific 2015 with Ms. Ober.

    content : My daughters have attended the Co-Op for 2yrs. From the moment we toured the school, the teacher, Ms. Ober, engaged my children’s curiosity and creativity. I am amazed by how they have developed a deep love of learning and by how much they actually know, before even entering kindergarten! My daughters can read some words, have an understanding of addition, subtraction, multiplication and fractions, and can count in multiple languages- all without workbooks and exercises. Play-based learning is amazing, and so is the Co-Op!

    content : Anna gets so excited for her helper days. She enjoys the task of coloring the water table and getting the paint brushes and paint set up for the day. All of the little responsibilities she has learned is amazing. She’s grown so much and I am so happy with my decision to send her to the Co-Op. It was the perfect stepping stone to ready her for kindergarten.
