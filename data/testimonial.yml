    content : The summer playdates were a great way to meet the families before the school year started.  I also appreciated the home visit before the start of school from our teacher Ms. Ober.  Her visit got my daughter so excited for her first day.

    content : Our new teacher, Ms. Pam Ober, has been a model of patience, kindness, and enthusiasm for our children.  Fall has been so much fun in Mrs. Ober's class.  We went  apple picking, tasted the apples for snack, then the children made a felt board model of the different types of apples.  We had a frighteningly cute Halloween parade and Party where the kids, parents, and Ms. Ober got in the spirit.  Most recently, we made a Sharing Soup that each child brought in an ingredient.  What a great hands-on way to taste the benefit of sharing!  We are looking forward to a terrific 2015 with Ms. Ober.
